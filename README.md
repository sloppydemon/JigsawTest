# JigsawTest
 
An experiment in creating a jigsaw puzzle simulator with procedurally generated board.

Started out following this tutorial: https://faramira.com/implement-bezier-curve-using-csharp-in-unity/ but wanted physical, 3D-pieces so ended up mostly using the bezier curve-calculations and making my own system for generating lines.
